# Subfluence Video Sharing

**Problem Statement:**
Education is crucial in today's day and age. With students balancing their lives between work and school, finding the right resources to help them to succeed in their classes isn’t the simplest of tasks—especially if students work multiple jobs. Subfluence fixes this problem by providing students 24/7 access to its platform, where students can find tutorial videos and other resources for any class. This platform will provide students the convenience of getting help with class work, at their own convenience.


**Abstract:**
Today, there are numerous students who are seeking assistance with class materials. Campus resources, such as peer-connections tutoring is not always available, when students need an in-person tutor the most. With the pandemic still affecting the world, it is also difficult to find and book in-person tutors. What if there was a platform where students can get 24/7 help with any assignments for a small monthly subscription fee? With Subfluence, it's now possible for students to get the help they need, whenever and wherever! 

**Approach:**
Create a website/webapp using a MERN stack, hosted using a Cloud infrastructure by AWS, that will allow teacher/business users to upload content to the database and student users to subscribe to existing content creators. React frontend will handle the user input while the Express/Node backend will perform all the logic and communicate with the MongoDB Atlas cloud database. The application source code will be hosted through EC2 virtual machine.

**Persona:**
Students with a busy work/life schedule who need a convenient way to get personalized assistance with their classes. 

Teachers/tutors who want to get seen and make money. Students wanting a more streamlined learning experience or help
